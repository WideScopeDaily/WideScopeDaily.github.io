    <!-- Article Body(originally written by Wide Scope Daily; based on reporting of the Nature article)  -->
    <p>A recent U.S. government report authored by a small team of critics of mainstream climate science sparked immediate controversy after its release. The document, assembled under Department of Energy oversight, downplayed the projected economic harms of rising global temperatures and questioned long-standing scientific assessments. Researchers across universities and institutions responded swiftly, arguing that the report misrepresents evidence and understates climate risks.</p>

    <p>Leading climate scientists described the report as biased in its selection of contributors and skeptical in tone. Many pointed out that the panel’s composition , selected by senior officials , raises concerns about independence and whether the analysis reflects the broader scientific consensus built over decades of peer-reviewed research.</p>

    <p>Academic voices quickly organized formal rebuttals. Some researchers warned that allowing this report to shape policy or court decisions could have long-term consequences. Legal observers noted the timing is significant: the report may influence judicial review and regulatory debates at the federal level, including cases that could reach the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Scientists stressed that recent peer-reviewed studies continue to show mounting evidence of growing economic and social costs tied to unchecked warming. They argued the government summary glosses over important regional impacts, extreme-weather trends, and the costs of infrastructure damage , elements that factor heavily into mainstream risk assessments.</p>

      <p>In public statements, some authors of the government report defended their credentials and invited further feedback. The Department of Energy opened a period for public comment, seeking input from experts and citizens. Researchers say that while feedback windows are useful, they are not a substitute for careful peer review and broad scientific vetting.</p>

      <p>Beyond immediate rebuttals, the episode prompted renewed discussion in the scientific community about safeguarding the integrity of policy-facing reports. Many researchers called for transparent author selection, clearer conflict-of-interest disclosures, and stronger links between government summaries and the peer-reviewed literature that underpins them.</p>
