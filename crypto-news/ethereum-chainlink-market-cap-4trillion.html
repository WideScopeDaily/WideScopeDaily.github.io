  <h2>Bitcoin Surges Past $65,000 as ETF Inflows Continue</h2>
  <div class="meta">Published on August 10, 2025 | Category: Crypto News</div>

  <p>Bitcoin has once again surged above the $65,000 mark as strong inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signal renewed investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts attribute the rise to a combination of institutional demand and favorable macroeconomic conditions.</p>

  <p>Data from multiple sources show that Bitcoin ETFs have seen consecutive days of net inflows, suggesting that institutional investors are steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin despite recent volatility. This trend has fueled optimism among traders, with many predicting a potential push toward the previous all-time high in the coming months.</p>

  <p>Market experts also point to easing inflation fears and anticipation of favorable regulatory developments as contributing factors to Bitcoin's upward momentum. However, they caution that the crypto market remains sensitive to macroeconomic shifts and regulatory announcements.</p>
